# pushbullet_notification
I have installed pushbullet on my computer and with this python script I can send notifications to it, 
using the pushbullete API (https://docs.pushbullet.com/).

In order to user it - you just have to add your authkey in the variable, change the message that you
want to send and you are good to go.

Also do not forget to replace the first line of the script with the correct path to the python version you want
to use. (you can find it with "whereis python")
