# pushbullet_notification
I have installed pushbullet on my computer and with this python script I can send notifications to it, 
using the pushbullete API (https://docs.pushbullet.com/).

In order to user it - you just have to add your authkey in the variable, change the message that you
want to send and you are good to go.
